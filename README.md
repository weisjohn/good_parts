Notes made while reading JavaScript the Good Parts
================================

A test program that lets me view and load JS files.

As I am reading through the book, I'm able to build sample files for each section.



What?
------------------------------------------------------------
These are snippets / notes from the book that I made / used to learn the techniques from Douglas Crockford's <a href="http://jsninja.com">JavaScript: the Good Parts</a>. 


Why?
------------------------------------------------------------
For fun and profit. Mainly because I was out of stuff to do...
